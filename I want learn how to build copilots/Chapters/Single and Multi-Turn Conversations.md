# What are single-turn coversations?
Single turn conversations that include one question and one response. A user cannot ask a follow up question without stating the original context and information again, and the follow up question would be regarded as a new question, with one response. 

Single turn conversations are useful in scenarios where a user is looking for information, not likely to follow up, such as 'What are the Redmond's Store Opening Hours?' 

# What are multi-turn conversations? 
Multi-turn conversations allow for follow up questions beyond the single initial question and answer response. They allow a user to ask questions without needing to restate the information or even much context as the context is retained from the original question and answer. This saves time, allows for the application to answer the users questions with more depth and is often a more natural experience based on typical conversations.

Microsoft Copilot Studio supports both single and multi-turn conversations. When planning for your copilot, you should consider the types of questions a user may ask based on the scope of the copilot and if those would be used as a single or multi-turn type of conversational experience. The Generative Answers feature in Microsoft Copilot Studio supports multi-turn conversations, as do manually authored topics.
