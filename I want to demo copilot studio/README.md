# I want to demo Microsoft Copilot Studio

You have chosen this page because you have completed the material in the main [homepage](https://github.com/sarahcritchley/copilotstudioguidebook/blob/main/README.md) and have some sort of demonstration scheduled, internally or externally, to complete which includes Microsoft Copilot Studio. 

Alternatively, you might have come straight to this page looking for a shortcut on demonstrating Microsoft Copilot Studio quickly.

This page includes a quick ramp up on setting up a demonstration environment from scratch with key features and functionality of Microsoft Copilot Studio. Following these steps, you should be able to get an environment with key features of Microsoft Copilot Studio setup in less than 30 minutes.

*Note: You will gain very limited knowledge if you prioritize setup speed over product knowledge and understanding. That may not be your goal, which is completely fine.*

*If you have not completed the main material on the homepage, it is likely you will not understand core terminology that is used to explain the functionality within the demostration, nor mentioned in the presentation decks and setup material, so it will impact your ability to present and answer questions. It is with full recommendation to go back and complete the material on the homepage before continuing if you have not done so already.*

Future versions I will plan to include sections on positioning, introductory and depth content for demonstrations purposes. These versions plan to also include demo material on how to extend existing copilots, such as Copilot for Service, with Microsoft Copilot Studio.

That said let's dive in.

## Create your Environment

Microsoft Partners should have access to the [Customer Digital Experience (CDX) platform](https://cdx.transform.microsoft.com/). If you do not, you need to ask your Partner Development Manager or Practice Leaders for access. An alternative option is to configure and setup a developer account, however requires much more work and steps including using your own personal email. If you wish to go down this route, a step by step guide on setting up a developer account is [here](https://microsoftcopilotstudio.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/signing-up-for-a-developer-plan-for-power-virtual-agents/#:~:text=Getting%20started%3A%201%201.%20Obtain%20a%20personal%20account,4.%20Get%20creating%20with%20Power%20Virtual%20Agents%20).

1. If using CDX, navigate to the website, sign in

2. Select 'My Environments', 'Create Tenant' and select 'Microsoft 365 Enterprise Demo Content'. You can configure your tenant for 90 days or 1 year depending on how long you need your environment. 

3. This will take only a few moments to provision and provide you with credentials to login. This has setup most of the ground work for you for demo applications, such as Microsoft Teams, Office 365 and also most of the Power Platform. You just need to add Microsoft Copilot Studio.

4. The trial for Microsoft Copilot Studio includes premium connectivity to Power Automate flow and capabilities to utilize Generative Answers (you'll hit quota limits if you use this too much - see quota URLs)

5. Make a new browser profile with your new CDX envionment credentials and navigate to https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/. You'll be asked to sign up for a free trial. Complete the form based on your trial details and this will now be attached to your environment.

You should now have a Microsoft Copilot Studio environment to setup your material for your demonstrations. This environment also contains additional user logins which is accessable in the CDX Environment Dashboard. 

Remember in Microsoft Copilot Studio you can access the YAML code for each topic. If you build a copilot, you should consider backing up the YAML files to ensure you can simply repeat the process and make a new copilot at any time and paste your YAML files into empty topics to not have to start from scratch. This is a great way to speed up your demostration process as you grow your knowledge and make changes.

## Key Features to Configure

You should look at configuring the following features and capabilities. Each item links to their respective pages which includes YAML code where relevant:

* [Generative Answers](https://github.com/sarahcritchley/copilotstudioguidebook/blob/main/I%20want%20to%20demo%20copilot%20studio/Chapters/Generative%20Answers%20Demo.md) 

* Create a [manually authored topic](https://github.com/sarahcritchley/copilotstudioguidebook/blob/main/I%20want%20to%20demo%20copilot%20studio/Chapters/Creating%20Topics%20Demo.md) to showcase the authoring canvas (and demostrate creating one using Copilot)

* [Fallback](https://github.com/sarahcritchley/copilotstudioguidebook/blob/main/I%20want%20to%20demo%20copilot%20studio/Chapters/Fallback%20Demo.md) 

* [Disambuation](https://github.com/sarahcritchley/copilotstudioguidebook/blob/main/I%20want%20to%20demo%20copilot%20studio/Chapters/Disambiguation%20Demo.md)

* Add [Generative Answers inside a node and include custom prompt](https://github.com/sarahcritchley/copilotstudioguidebook/blob/main/I%20want%20to%20demo%20copilot%20studio/Chapters/Custom%20Prompt%20Demo.md)

* Modifying [the Conversation Start](https://github.com/sarahcritchley/copilotstudioguidebook/blob/main/I%20want%20to%20demo%20copilot%20studio/Chapters/Conversation%20Start.md)

* Include plugins such as Power Automate to show utilizing external data (specific demo guide coming soon, but [start here](https://github.com/sarahcritchley/copilotstudioguidebook/blob/main/I%20want%20learn%20how%20to%20build%20copilots/Chapters/Copilot%20Studio%20Plugins.md))

* Modifying Generative Answers to check for keywords or phrases (coming soon)

* Expand Gen Answers data sources to 3P and more e.g. sharepoint (coming soon)

* Custom Events (coming soon)

By following the pages above, you should have a Copilot that you can demostrate key functionality of the Microsoft Copilot Studio product. 

Of course, it doesn't stop there, this is a quick start guide to a demonstration to hit the high notes, however feel free to get created and explore some of the more in depth functionality like CLU, Multi-lingual support and more.

## Presentation Material

You should have access to the presentation material, which includes the pitch deck, in the Power Platform Partner Hub which can be accessed via the Go To Market Tab (you need to be signed in).
